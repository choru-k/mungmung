# Item 1 — Define on_click execution context contract

## Goal
Define deterministic shell execution rules for on_click behavior.

## Completion Notes
- Documented shell resolution order (`MUNG_ON_CLICK_SHELL` → `SHELL` → `/bin/sh`).
- Documented working-directory and debug controls.
- Clarified shared click/CLI dismissal path in docs.
