# Item 1 — Publish adapter contract and lifecycle guidance

## Goal
Make adapter expectations explicit so new integrations can be built from docs alone.

## Completion Notes
- Added adapter contract table (required/strongly recommended/optional flags).
- Added lifecycle mapping for session start, updates, action prompts, and shutdown.
- Documented the same guidance in both README and SPEC.
